# IR_Assignment2
The project implements a simple Information Retrieval (IR) system that builds an inverted index from a collection of text documents, allowing users to perform keyword-based searches. The system ranks documents based on their relevance to the search query using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) metric and cosine similarity.
